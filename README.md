# ipfs-uploader

Files manipulation and adds to IPFS gracefully

Confirmed working on Windows 7+ and Linux. Untested on mac.

Dependencies required:

- either `dotnet-sdk-2.0` for dev
- or `dotnet-runtime` for production
- `ffmpeg`
- `ffprobe`
- `imagemagick`
- `ipfs` (go-ipfs) with a running deamon

## Starting it in dev mode

Navigate to the `Uploader.Web` directory and just do `dotnet run`

## Available Calls

Once your instance is started, it should listen on localhost:5000 by default and serve all these calls.

## GET

- `/getStatus` and `/getStatus?details=true` will give some information about the running instance such as queues times and usage statistics
- `/getErrors` will give information about recent errors
- `/index.html` allows you to easily test video, image and subtitles uploads. Only available in dev mode
- `/getProgressByToken/:token` answers with a json object representing the progress of the upload
- - token: is the token given after a succesful `/uploadVideo` or `/uploadImage`
- `/getProgressBySourceHash/:token` same as above but takes the source video hash as input

## POST

- `/uploadVideo` The main video upload call
  - POST file input `files`. Needs to be a video otherwise it will end up as an error.
- - Query String Options
    - videoEncodingFormats: controls which video resolutions are requested for the encoding
    - sprite: true/false. Controls whether a sprite file should be generated for this video.

Curl example: `curl -F "video=@./video.mp4" http://localhost:5000/uploadVideo?videoEncodingFormats=240p,480p,720p&sprite=true`

- `/uploadImage`

  - POST file input `files`. Needs to be an image otherwise it will end up as an error.

- `/uploadSubtitle`
  - POST text input `subtitle`. Needs to be a string starting with WEBVTT otherwise it will end up as an error.

## Configuration

The main config file is available as `appsettings.json`.

- Front :
  - "CORS": "http://localhost:3000" Cross-origin domains to authorize requests from.
- General :
  - "MaxGetProgressCanceled": 20, The number of seconds after which an upload gets cancelled if the user doesn't request a `/getProgressByX`.
  - "ImageMagickPath": "", The path to imagemagick (leave blank if you use linux).
  - "TempFilePath": "/tmp/dtube", Path of temporary files created during the encoding and ipfs processes.
  - "ErrorFilePath": "/home/dtube/errors", Path where uploaded files creating errors get stored .
  - "FinalFilePath": "/home/dtube/success", Path where succesfully uploaded files to IPFS get stored (if OnlyHash option is true).
  - "Version": "0.7.5" The version of the running instance.
- Encode (array) : the list of possible video qualities encoded by this instance.
  - "urlTag": "720p", The tag that represents a quality.
  - "maxRate": "2000k", The video bitrate.
  - "width": 1280, Video width.
  - "height": 720, Video height.
  - "MinSourceHeightForEncoding": 600, Minimum source height for allowing encoding to this quality.
  - "qualityOrder": 5 To order different qualities. Higher is higher quality.
- Ipfs :
  - "IpfsTimeout": 108000, IPFS add timeout in seconds
  - "VideoAndSpriteTrickleDag": true, If true, uses -t (trickle dag) option for adding video and sprite files to IPFS. Recommended.
  - "AddVideoSource": true, If true, the source file also gets added to IPFS.
  - "OnlyHash": false If true, uses --only-hash option of IPFS and moves files to the FinalFilePath instead or adding to the ipfs datastore directly.
- Video :
  - "FfProbeTimeout": 10, ffprobe timeout in seconds.
  - "EncodeGetImagesTimeout": 600, Timeout in seconds for generating all pictures composing the sprite.
  - "EncodeTimeout": 108000, Timeout in seconds for video encoding.
  - "MaxVideoDurationForEncoding": 1800, Maximum video duration in seconds for video encoding.
  - "NbSpriteImages": 100, Number of total images used in the sprite.
  - "HeightSpriteImages": 118, Sprite height.
  - "GpuEncodeMode": true, Enables GPU-encoding.
  - "NbSpriteDaemon": 0, Number of daemons generating sprites.
  - "NbAudioVideoCpuEncodeDaemon": 0, Number of daemons for CPU audio and video encoding.
  - "NbAudioCpuEncodeDaemon": 0, Number of daemons for CPU audio only encoding (used when doing GPU video encoding).
  - "NbVideoGpuEncodeDaemon": 0, Number of daemons for GPU video encoding.
  - "AuthorizedQuality": "240p,480p,720p", Authorized encoding qualities. Any other requested quality will be ignored.
  - "NVidiaCard":"QuadroP5000" GPU card model.

## Building and running it in production

### Building

`dotnet publish -c Release` will create a /bin/Release/netcoreapp2.0/publish folder

### Running

Navigate to the publish folder and `dotnet Uploader.Web.dll`

### Logging

Everything gets logged inside the `logs` folder and each process has it's own log file (ffmpeg, ipfs, etc). If you want logs in a different folder, you need to edit the `log4net.config` file.
